## What is Howler

Howler is a social media app that focuses on short form text based content. Much twitter a user on howler has the ability to post or "Howl" about anything he desires while adding some images if he/she wants to.

## Why Build Howler ?

Howler was my attempt at re-learing firebase with the new update of firebase v9. You might say that making a fully functioning social media website is pretty extreme to re-learn firebase, and I would agree with you but I got a bit carried away.

## The Technologies Behind Howler

Howler uses Next.js as a React.js framework, Firebase as a database and authentication means, and Recoil for state management.
